# FT-EMS

Welcome to Fizzy’s Tech Electronics Management System (FT EMS).

Originally developed for the Voron V0.2, this project started as a solution to the all-too-common problem of mounting electronics with VHB tape. It quickly evolved into a broader, more versatile system — replacing DIN rails on larger printers with a modular, streamlined alternative.

FT EMS now supports a range of popular printers, including the Voron 2, Voron Trident, Voron V0, and Voron Switchwire, just to name a few. We’ve also built custom frames for popular conversion projects like FT Enderwire.

Over time, our library has expanded significantly — not just with printer-specific frames, but also with a wide and growing collection of component mounts designed to attach seamlessly to the EMS frame.

The latest update as of July 2025:
We’ve officially released FT EMS for the Voron 2.4 (350mm) — an LDO-exclusive version of our electronics management system. This edition is now available for purchase through authorized LDO resellers.
